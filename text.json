The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided\\n                  by your mobile network provider, but RCC Comunity\\n                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full\\n                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t\\n                  have any of your data allowance left.\\n                  \\n                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you\\n                  should remember that the terms of the agreement with your\\n                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may\\n                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for\\n                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or\\n                  other third-party charges.
